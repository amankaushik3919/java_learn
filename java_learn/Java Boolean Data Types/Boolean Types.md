# Boolean Types
Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:
- Yes/No
- On/Off
- True/False

for these types of data java has `boolean` data type.
Which takes the values `true` or `false`.

```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun);
System.out.println(isFishTasty);
```

--------
Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing.
