The `char` data type is used to store `single` character. The character must be surrounded by the
`single quotes`, like 'A' or 'C'.

```java
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);
```

ASCII values can also be used to display certain characters.

```java
char myVar1 = 65, myVar = 66, myVar = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);
```

# Strings (Non-Primitive)
The `String` data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text).
String values must be surrounded by double quotes.

```java
String greeting = "Hello World";
System.out.println(greeting);
```
